🧠 How It Works
The inputs typed into the form (like email and password) are handled on the frontend using React state.

To make the app functional (e.g., to store user data or log in), you'll need to connect it to a backend using APIs.

🔮 Future Improvements
Connect to a backend like Firebase or Node.js with Express.

Add form validation and error messages.

Include password visibility toggle.

Add animations for smoother user experience.
